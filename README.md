## What's Maccard?
Maccard is companion/utility for macOS that is aimed to replace your dock and launcher(s). The idea is to have a quick way to navigate and manage your Mac, all in one place. (I’ve personally found it really great when running fullscreen apps, since Maccard can appear on any desktop or application.)      

## System Requirements
- macOS 10.15 (Catalina) or later
- ~250-300mb free disk space
- An active internet connection (initial setup/launch only)

## What does Maccard look like?
Maccard has two layouts:
- 'Card' layout:

- Taskbar/Compact layout:

## Activating Maccard
Once you've installed Maccard, launch the app from your Applications folder. Two icons will appear:   
- One in your macOS Dock:

- And one in your Menubar:

To show or hide the main window in card mode, you can either  
### Click on one of the dock or Menubar icon
or 
### Use the systemwide keyboard shortcut (Ctrl+Space)

## Updating Maccard
Maccard v0.4.1 introduces an in-app updater, which will check for updates, download the latest release (if available), and mount the update's DMG all without leaving the app.

If you want to install updates manually, you can download the latest update from Maccard's releases, and mount the DMG to install. 

## Features and teasers
I’ll be posting updates with screenshots and extra info on my Twitter, Mastodon, and Discord; all of which are on my website (links below). Additionally, the GitHub page will show less-frequent updates, but will have information pertaining to the app, and will serve to download beta releases of the app!
