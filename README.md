## What's Maccard?
Maccard is companion/utility for macOS that is aimed to replace your dock and launcher(s). The idea is to have a one-stop-shop/replacement hub for your Menubar, Control Center, and Dock. The goal is to be able to use MacCard as a quick way to navigate and manage your Mac, all in one place. (I’ve personally found it really great when running fullscreen apps, since Maccard can appear on any desktop or application.)

## How do I use Maccard?
Once you've installed Maccard, launch the app from your Applications folder. Two icons will appear:   
- One in your macOS Dock:

- And one in your Menubar:

Clicking on either will show or hide the main window:

## Community feedback
I want to hear from you all! When developing a solution like this, I really wanted to get as much input from Mac-specific users as possible to see what information and utility they would want to have. What would you want a shell utility such as this to show? If you have any suggestions, complaints, ideas, or otherwise, feel free to leave them below, or on any of my socials, which you can find below!

I’ll be posting updates with screenshots and extra info on my Twitter and Mastodon, both of which are on my website (links below). Additionally, the GitHub page will show less-frequent updates, but will have information pertaining to the app, and will serve to download beta releases of the app in the coming weeks!
